# financeApp
Project for managing personal investments in the stock market

To run it:

`python financeApp.py`


I made this app for my dad to help him to manage his investments in the stock market.

Its helpfull as it allows to keep track of your investments during time, updating the prices with inflation data obtained from the European Central Bank and visually understand if an investment is profitable over time considering also inflation. If more then one purchase of the same stock (e.g., META in the image below) were done over time, the update with inflation is done separately for each transaction. 
This kind of data is not particularly complex to retrieve but still not available in the application of my bank, which I usually use to invest in the stock market.
